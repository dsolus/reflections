When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So you can share it with yourself in multiple locations or others working on the
same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Pulling changes from the repo is a logical change you need to control. If other
people are working on a project then automatic pulls may update changes to your
work with out your consent.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is essentially a copy of a repo on github. A clone is a copy of a repo
taking from git hub and present on your personal machine. Branches are new
paths of commit history within a given project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Haveing a copy of the remote stored locally on your machine allows you to check
the progress of your work with the offical version available on github. This
ablitiy is useful to pick which posted commits you want to include in your 
version and which local commits you want to push to github.
