#Lesson 2 Reflections.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is intialized it opens the directory up to git
for file tracking. When you commit the repository you may be able
choose to commit all the files or select individuals to omit?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers a snapshot of the working directory, showing both
untracked files and files to be commited. This will be useful to break up
commits into 'logical change' steps. So if you complete changes to a single
file but continue working on another you can add the completed file to the
staging area.
